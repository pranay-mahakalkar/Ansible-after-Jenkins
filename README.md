# Ansible-after-Jenkins
Automating deployments to DEV and QA environments using Jenkins and Ansible involves creating a CI/CD pipeline. 
Setup Jenkins Job:

Create a new Jenkins job for your project.
Configure the job to trigger on code commits or as needed.
Integrate Jenkins with Source Code Repository:

Connect Jenkins to your version control system (e.g., Git).
Configure Jenkins to pull the source code during the build process.
Build Script:

Create a build script (e.g., using Maven or Gradle) to compile your code and generate artifacts.
Artifact Archiving:

Archive the build artifacts (JARs, WARs, etc.) in Jenkins.
Configure Jenkins to Call Ansible:

Install the Ansible plugin in Jenkins.
Add a post-build action in Jenkins to call Ansible.
Ansible Playbook:

Write an Ansible playbook that defines the tasks needed for deployment.
Include tasks such as copying artifacts to the target servers, updating configurations, and restarting services.
Example Ansible Playbook (deploy.yml):

yaml file
---
- name: Deploy to DEV and QA Environments
  hosts: dev_and_qa_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Copy artifacts
      copy:
        src: /path/to/jenkins/artifacts
        dest: /app/deployment/

    - name: Update configuration
      template:
        src: templates/application.conf.j2
        dest: /app/deployment/application.conf
      notify:
        - Restart Service

    - name: Ensure services are running
      service:
        name: my_application
        state: restarted

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Service
      service:
        name: my_application
        state: restarted

In this example, replace /path/to/jenkins/artifacts with the actual path in Jenkins where artifacts are stored.

Inventory File:

Maintain an Ansible inventory file with details of your DEV and QA servers.
Example Inventory File (inventory.ini):

ini
[dev_and_qa_servers]
dev-server ansible_host=dev.example.com
qa-server ansible_host=qa.example.com
Run the Jenkins Job:

Trigger the Jenkins job manually or let it run automatically on code changes.
Jenkins will build the code, archive artifacts, and then call Ansible to deploy to DEV and QA environments.
Ensure Ansible is installed on the Jenkins server, and SSH connectivity is established between Jenkins and the target servers. Adjust the playbook and configurations according to your project's needs.
